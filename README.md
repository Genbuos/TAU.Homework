You can assing a value to a variable in one of several ways including:
1. type a literal value after the equals sign (x=12, isGood =  true, etc)
2. assing the value of one variable to another (x=y)
3. use an expression comining the two (x = y + 43)
4. It must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign. You can't start a name with a number.
5. After the first character you can use numbers as well just not starting with a number.
6. It can be anything you like, subject to those two rules, just so long as it isn't one of Java's reserved keywords(a list can be found in w3 schools)


 There is no such thing as an object variable there is only an object reference variable.
 An object reference variable holds buts that represent a way to access an object.

# Chapter 5 - 10 notes
